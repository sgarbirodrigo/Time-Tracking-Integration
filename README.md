**Usage**
---

While in Jira, you should use the Scrum Board to control your projects.
When starting a sprint, you will have three columns: Todo Doing and Done.

 - Once you put your tasks in Doing, they will appear in this app so you can click on it and start tracking your work/study.
 - After you finish your pomodoro time, it will save it to toggl so you can generate better reports and save it in jira tasks.
 - The color of the background will change as long you get closer to your daily target of work/study hours.

** TODOs **
---

1. Implement better alarm system so it would not be necessary to stay with the app open. Still not being able to make the app run in the background on Iphone;
2. Allow to work easily on multiple projects.
